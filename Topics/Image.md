# Lesson 2: Creating a Sample Document

WhatsApp
What is WhatsApp?
WhatsApp (officially WhatsApp Messenger) is a free communication app which allows you to send messages, make voice and video calls, and share images and documents, user locations, and other content. Two former Yahoo! developers launched WhatsApp in January 2009.  Later in January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client. With more than two and a half billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is one of the most successful apps ever made.

WhatsApp is an effective tool to communicate with people one-on-one or in groups. You can easily send files, pictures, documents, and more with a single click. With end-to-end encryption your messages and calls stay between you and the person you and who you send them to. The WhatsApp Business feature helps you to engage with your audience, accelerate sales and build an effective customer support platform for your business.

Better Security: End-to-end encryption is used to send and receive WhatsApp messages.
low-cost: SMS messages have higher associated costs as they are transmitted over traditional mobile network channels.
Searchable: The content of historical WhatsApp messages is easier to search for because the messages you receive are stored in a structured format.
Cross-Compatibility: WhatsApp Web enables the option to use WhatsApp on a tablet/laptop/PC.
