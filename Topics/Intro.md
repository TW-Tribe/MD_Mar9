WhatsApp
What is WhatsApp?
WhatsApp (officially WhatsApp Messenger) is a free communication app which allows you to send messages, make voice and video calls, and share images and documents, user locations, and other content. Two former Yahoo! developers launched WhatsApp in January 2009.  Later in January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client. With more than two and a half billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is one of the most successful apps ever made. 
WhatsApp sounds like whatâ€™s Up? With App combined. The founders of this App are Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo. WhatsApp came into our lives in February 2009 to be the most popular messaging App, an alternative to SMS, with more than a million users. The App uses the internet to send messages and images, allowing family and friends to stay in touch with each other, anytime and anywhere. The App has features like group chatting, voice message and location sharing, while bringing all categories of people into the world of WhatsApp.
WhatsApp is the largest online messenger app in the world, owned by Facebook. In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, and by 2017, it reached 1 billion users. WhatsApp is a messenger app for smartphones, laptops, and PCs. It uses the internet to send text messages, images, audio, and video. WhatsApp has awesome features such as group chatting, voice messages, new communities, and location sharing. 
WhatsApp is free to get. If the user doesn't have an internet connection, they can choose to use cellular data.

Benefits of WhatsApp

WhatsApp is an effective tool to communicate with people one-on-one or in groups. You can easily send files, pictures, documents, and more with a single click.
